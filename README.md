# PurpleFace_levels
This repo contains levels for [PurpleFace](https://github.com/2028games/PurpleFace). The contained levels are downloadable directly from the game, using the "Download more Levels" button.

#Making your own levels
If you want to make your own PurpleFace levels, then you should fork this repository. After that, download [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/), the map editor, and you will be able to open/edit existing levels to make your own. New levels can be copied in the Levels directory of the game to become detected by the game, or you can edit your `level_download_dir` label of your `settings.txt` file (located in `~/.PurpleFace/settings.txt` in Linux). Finally, you can pull request your new levels, so that they can be made accessible by anyone.
If you want more help making levels, you can contact the developer at thkatsios@gmail.com.
